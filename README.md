# Bachelor Thesis - Final Year Project - Medical Bracelet sends data (Heart-rate / ECG) to Webpage and Mobile App in real-time
- Development of a **portable medical bracelet** which combined both heart rate and electrocardiogram measurements transmitted wirelessly to a webpage and a mobile application in real-time 
- Achieved heart-rate measurements with **error of only 0.46% when compared to Apple Watch** 
- Sensor interface using **Arduino IDE**
- Webpage development using **Ubidots IoT Cloud Service**
- Mobile App development using **Blynk**
- Achieved **82% in the Bachelor Thesis (First-Class)**

## Organisation of Repository
- In `CAD_Models`, the 3D CAD designs of the bracelet are included which were implemented in **SolidWorks and 3D-printed**
- In `Component_Testing`, the source code used to test the heart-rate, ECG sensors and the Wi-Fi modules is presented (**Arduino and C++**)
- In `PCB`, the designs of the PCB integrating all components are found designed in **Altium PCB Designer**
- In `Reports`, all the **files that documented the progress of the project** throughout the year are presented
